alias(cmd, orig) > Sets an alias of `orig` to `cmd`

appendPath(dir) > Appends `dir` to $PATH

complete(scope, cb) > Registers a completion handler for `scope`.
A `scope` is currently only expected to be `command.<cmd>`,
replacing <cmd> with the name of the command (for example `command.git`).
`cb` must be a function that returns a table of the entries to complete.
Nested tables will be used as sub-completions.

exec(cmd) > Replaces running hilbish with `cmd`

goro(fn) > Puts `fn` in a goroutine

interval(cb, time) > Runs the `cb` function every `time` milliseconds

multiprompt(str) > Changes the continued line prompt to `str`

prependPath(dir) > Prepends `dir` to $PATH

 prompt(str) > Changes the shell prompt to `str`
There are a few verbs that can be used in the prompt text.
These will be formatted and replaced with the appropriate values.
`%d` - Current working directory
`%u` - Name of current user
`%h` - Hostname of device

timeout(cb, time) > Runs the `cb` function after `time` in milliseconds
