But if you&amp;rsquo;re normal, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be using Hilbish anyway but you&amp;rsquo;d also not want this (or maybe want Lua only in some cases.)
The &amp;ldquo;runner mode&amp;rdquo; of Hilbish is customizable via hilbish.runnerMode, which determines how Hilbish will run user input. By default, this is set to hybrid which is the previously mentioned behaviour of running Lua first then going to shell script.</description></item></channel></rss>
