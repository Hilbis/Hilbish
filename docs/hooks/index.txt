Here is listed all scopes for bait hooks. If a hook is related to a command,
it will have the `command` scope, as example.

Here is the format for a doc for a hook:
+ <hook name> -> <args> > <description>

`<args>` just means the arguments of the hook. If a hook doc has the format
of `arg...`, it means the hook can take/recieve any number of `arg`.
