A bit after creation, we have the outside nature. Little plants, seeds,
growing to their final phase: a full plant. A lot of Hilbish itself is
written in Go, but there are parts made in Lua, being the `doc` command,
command not executable/found hooks to print a message in the shell,
and other things.

Hilbish's Lua core module is called `nature`. It's handled after everything
on the Go side initializes, which is what that first sentence was from.

# Nature Modules
Currently, `nature` provides 1 intended public module: `nature.dirs`.
It is a simple API for managing recent directories and old
current working directory.
