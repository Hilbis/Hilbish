No, it is not. POSIX compliance is a non-goal. Perhaps in the future, someone would be able to write a native plugin to support shell scripting (which would be against it&amp;rsquo;s main goal, but &amp;hellip;.)
Windows Support? It compiles for Windows (CI ensures it does), but otherwise it is not directly supported. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to improve this situation, checkout the discussion .
Where is the API documentation?</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/docs/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/docs/getting-started/</guid><description>To start Hilbish, open a terminal. If Hilbish has been installed and is not the default shell, you can simply run hilbish to start it. This will launch a normal interactive session. To exit, you can either run the exit command or hit Ctrl+D.
Setting as Default Login shell There are a few ways to make Hilbish your default shell. A simple way is to make it your user/login shell.</description></item><item><title>Install</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/install/</guid><description>Github Prebuilt Binaries The easiest and best way to get Hilbish is directly from Github.

But if you&amp;rsquo;re normal, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be using Hilbish anyway but you&amp;rsquo;d also not want this (or maybe want Lua only in some cases.)
The &amp;ldquo;runner mode&amp;rdquo; of Hilbish is customizable via hilbish.runnerMode, which determines how Hilbish will run user input. By default, this is set to hybrid which is the previously mentioned behaviour of running Lua first then going to shell script.</description></item></channel></rss>
