# Hilbish
ðŸŽ€ a nice lil shell for lua people made with go and lua

# Building
Prebuilt binaries are not yet provided, since Hilbish is not stable.  
It is usable though, so to try it out you'll have to manually compile.  

**NOTE:** Hilbish is currently only officially supported and tested on Linux

### Requirements
- Go 1.16

### Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/Hilbis/Hilbish
cd Hilbish
go build
```

This will build a `hilbish` executable in the current directory. 
At which you can either run or move to a bin directory for easy use.
