Hilbish is an interactive Unix-like shell written in Go, with the config
and other code written in Lua.  
It is sort of in a stable state currently, usable as a daily shell,
but there may still be breaking changes in Lua modules.

On OpenSUSE, it can be installed with:
```
sudo zypper install readline-devel
```

On Arch Linux, it can be installed with:
```
sudo pacman -S install readline
```

#### Build
First, clone Hilbish:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Hilbis/Hilbish
cd Hilbish
# If you want the latest stable release, run this following command
git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
```   

And get dependencies and build:  
```sh
go get -d all
make dev
# If you want to use latest stable release,
