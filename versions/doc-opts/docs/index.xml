No, it is not. POSIX compliance is a non-goal. Perhaps in the future, someone would be able to write a native plugin to support shell scripting (which would be against it&amp;rsquo;s main goal, but &amp;hellip;.)
Windows Support? It compiles for Windows (CI ensures it does), but otherwise it is not directly supported. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to improve this situation, checkout the discussion .
Where is the API documentation?</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/docs/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/docs/getting-started/</guid><description>To start Hilbish, open a terminal. If Hilbish has been installed and is not the default shell, you can simply run hilbish to start it. This will launch a normal interactive session. To exit, you can either run the exit command or hit Ctrl+D.
Setting as Default Login shell There are a few ways to make Hilbish your default shell. A simple way is to make it your user/login shell.</description></item><item><title>Opts</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/docs/opts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 01:01:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/docs/opts/</guid><description>Opts are simple settings and switches to control certain Hilbish behavior. This ranges from things like the greeting messages on bootup to &amp;ldquo;autocd&amp;rdquo; functionality.
They can be changed via a simple assign (like hilbish.opts.namehere = true).
Available Opts autocd The autocd opt (default false) makes it so that if a lone path is ran, Hilbish will change directory to that path.
Example:
sammy ~ ∆ hilbish.opts.autocd = true sammy ~ ∆ ~/Downloads sammy ~/Downloads ∆ history This opt controls if Hilbish will store commands in history.</description></item></channel></rss>
