No, it is not. POSIX compliance is a non-goal. Perhaps in the future, someone would be able to write a native plugin to support shell scripting (which would be against it&amp;rsquo;s main goal, but &amp;hellip;.)
Windows Support? It compiles for Windows (CI ensures it does), but otherwise it is not directly supported. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to improve this situation, checkout the discussion .
Why? Hilbish emerged from the desire of a Lua configured shell.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/getting-started/</guid><description>To start Hilbish, open a terminal. If Hilbish has been installed and is not the default shell, you can simply run hilbish to start it. This will launch a normal interactive session. To exit, you can either run the exit command or hit Ctrl+D.
Setting as Default Login shell There are a few ways to make Hilbish your default shell. A simple way is to make it your user/login shell.</description></item><item><title>Improving Hilbish's Branding</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/improving-this-website/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 22:15:31 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/improving-this-website/</guid><description>Happy birthday Hilbish! As of last month, Hilbish is now 2 years old. Unfortunately I missed the official date, but I will still make a more focused post on the date (19st).
I decided to fix up this website and Hilbish&amp;rsquo;s logo, so that can be thought of as something for the 2 years milestone?
Logo Hilbish&amp;rsquo;s old logo was.. not that good. It definitely functioned as a logo, but the yellow part of it looked ugly (sorry old logo).</description></item><item><title>v2.1.2 Release</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.1.2-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 12:27:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.1.2-release/</guid><description>The release with full changelogs and prebuilt binaries can be seen at the v2.1.2 tag.
This release reverts the April Fool&amp;rsquo;s code additions in v2.1.1. It is functionally equal to v2.1.0. Nice!
A real release will come possibly in a few days or next week, so stay tuned for the good and feature-filled release of v2.2!</description></item><item><title>v2.1.1 Release</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.1.1-release/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 18:15:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.1.1-release/</guid><description>The release with full changelogs and prebuilt binaries can be seen at the v2.1.1 tag.
Welcome to a fresh new release of Hilbish! Some people (or none) may be awaiting the long coming v2.2 release with lots of features, but I needed to push out this little bug fix (wink) release.
Bug Fixes Validation checks for command input When running this version, you may have noticed an odd message that sometimes comes up when running commands.</description></item><item><title>v2.1 Release</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.1-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 18:25:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.1-release/</guid><description>The release with full changelogs and prebuilt binaries can be seen at the v2.1.0 tag.
Oh look! A new release of Hilbish! This time is the v2.1 release, with a small amount of features and mainly documentation changes and bug fixes.
Documentation There have been a few documentation enhancements for this release. This includes:
Adding the return types for all functions that need them Documenting Hilbish types like job objects and timers properly.</description></item><item><title>Hilbish v2.0 Release</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.0-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 01:55:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/blog/v2.0-release/</guid><description>Hilbish v2.0 has been released! Well actually, it was released a week ago, but I only wrote this Hilbish blog after that.
This is a big release, coming 9 months after the previous v1.2.0 and featuring over 40+ bug fixes and tons of new features and enhancements, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what is in this release.
Documentation When querying about the problems people have with Hilbish, one of the issues was its poor documentation.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/completions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/completions/</guid><description>Hilbish has a pretty good completion system. It has a nice looking menu, with 2 types of menus: grid (like file completions) or list.
Like most parts of Hilbish, it&amp;rsquo;s made to be extensible and customizable. The default handler for completions in general can be overwritten to provide more advanced completions if needed.
Completion Handler By default, it provides 3 things: for the first argument, binaries (with a plain name requested to complete, those in $PATH), files, or command completions.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/hooks/job/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/hooks/job/</guid><description>Note: job refers to a job object.

It&amp;rsquo;s missing one or two things, but works well. One thing which is different from other shells (besides Hilbish) itself is the API for jobs, and of course it&amp;rsquo;s in Lua. You can add jobs, stop and delete (disown) them and even get output.
Job Interface The job interface refers to hilbish.jobs.
Functions (Note that in the list here, they&amp;rsquo;re called from hilbish.jobs, so a listing of foo would mean hilbish.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/lunacolors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/lunacolors/</guid><description>Lunacolors is an ANSI color/styling library for Lua. It is included by default in standard Hilbish distributions to provide easy styling for things like prompts and text.
For simple usage, a single color or style is enough. For example, you can just use lunacolors.blue 'Hello world' and that&amp;rsquo;ll return blue text which you can print. This includes styles like bold, underline, etc.
In other usage, you may want to use a format string instead of having multiple nested functions for different styles.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/runner-mode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/runner-mode/</guid><description>Hilbish is unique, when interactive it first attempts to run input as Lua and then tries shell script. But if you&amp;rsquo;re normal, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be using Hilbish anyway but you&amp;rsquo;d also not want this (or maybe want Lua only in some cases.)
The &amp;ldquo;runner mode&amp;rdquo; of Hilbish is customizable via hilbish.runnerMode, which determines how Hilbish will run user input. By default, this is set to hybrid which is the previously mentioned behaviour of running Lua first then going to shell script.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/timers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/timers/</guid><description>This has been moved to the hilbish.timers API doc (accessible by doc api hilbish.timers)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/vim-mode/actions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/vim-mode/actions/</guid><description>Vim actions are essentially just when a user uses a Vim keybind. Things like yanking and pasting are Vim actions. This is not an &amp;ldquo;offical Vim thing,&amp;rdquo; just a Hilbish thing.

Much like Node.js and its events system, many actions in Hilbish emit events. Unlike Node.js, Hilbish events are global. So make sure to pick a unique name!
Usage of the Bait module consists of userstanding event-driven architecture, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple: If you want to act on a certain event, you can catch it. You can act on events via callback functions.</description></item><item><title>Module commander</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/api/commander/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/api/commander/</guid><description>Introduction Commander is a library for writing custom commands in Lua. In order to make it easier to write commands for Hilbish, not require separate scripts and to be able to use in a config, the Commander library exists. This is like a very simple wrapper that works with Hilbish for writing commands. Example:
1local commander = require &amp;#39;commander&amp;#39; 2 3commander.register(&amp;#39;hello&amp;#39;, function(args, sinks) 4 sinks.out:writeln &amp;#39;Hello world!&amp;#39; 5end) In this example, a command with the name of hello is created that will print Hello world!</description></item><item><title>Module fs</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/api/fs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/api/fs/</guid><description>Introduction The fs module provides easy and simple access to filesystem functions and other things, and acts an addition to the Lua standard library&amp;rsquo;s I/O and filesystem functions.

These are the simple functions hilbish.interval and hilbish.timeout (doc accessible with doc hilbish). But if you want slightly more control over them, there is the hilbish.timers interface. It allows you to get a timer via ID and control them.</description></item><item><title>Module hilbish.userDir</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/api/hilbish/hilbish.userdir/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/api/hilbish/hilbish.userdir/</guid><description> Introduction This interface just contains properties to know about certain user directories.

This is used via the hilbish.message interface.
A message is defined as a table with the following properties:
icon: A unicode/emoji icon for the notification. title: The title of the message text: Message text/body channel: The source of the message. This should be a unique and easily readable text identifier.</description></item><item><title>Runner Mode</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/features/runner-mode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/features/runner-mode/</guid><description>Hilbish allows you to change how interactive text can be interpreted. This is mainly due to the fact that the default method Hilbish uses is that it runs Lua first and then falls back to shell script.
In some cases, someone might want to switch to just shell script to avoid it while interactive but still have a Lua config, or go full Lua to use Hilbish as a REPL. This also allows users to add alternative languages like Fennel as the interactive script runner.</description></item><item><title>Signal</title><link>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/hooks/signal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/versions/doc-improvements/docs/hooks/signal/</guid><description>signal.sigint &amp;gt; Sent when Hilbish receives SIGINT (on Ctrl-C).
