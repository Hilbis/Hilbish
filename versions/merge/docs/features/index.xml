This is mainly due to the fact that the default method Hilbish uses is that it runs Lua first and then falls back to shell script.
In some cases, someone might want to switch to just shell script to avoid it while interactive but still have a Lua config, or go full Lua to use Hilbish as a REPL. This also allows users to add alternative languages, instead of either like Fennel.</description></item></channel></rss>
